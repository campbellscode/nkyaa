                    <li>We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.</li><br>
                    <li>We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.</li><br>
                    <li>We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace.</li><br>
                    <li>No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience can benefit others.</li><br>
                    <li>That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.</li><br>
                    <li>We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.</li><br>
                    <li>Self-seeking will slip away</li><br>
                    <li>Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.</li><br>
                    <li>. Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us.</li><br>
                    <li>We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.</li><br>
                    <li>We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.</li>

                Are these extravagant promises? We think not. They are being fulfilled among us -
                sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. They will always materialize if we work for them.
