                    <li>Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon A.A. unity.</li><br>
                    <li>For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority—a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.</li><br>
                    <li>The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.</li><br>
                    <li>Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or A.A. as a whole.</li><br>
                    <li>Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers.</li><br>
                    <li>An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the A.A. name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.</li><br>
                    <li>Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.</li><br>
                    <li>Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our service centers may employ special workers.</li><br>
                    <li>A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.</li><br>
                    <li>Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.</li><br>
                    <li>Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.</li><br>
                    <li>Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.</li>
